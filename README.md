## About
This repository provides solutions and explanations for various security challenges. The challenges span multiple domains, including:
- Reverse Engineering
- Binary Exploitation
- Web Security
- Cryptography
- Forensics

Each solution includes detailed explanations where necessary to enhance understanding.

## Challenges
Challenges are organized into separate directories based on their categories. Each directory contains scripts, binaries, and/or documentation explaining the approach used to solve the challenge.

## Setup
To run the solutions, ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+). Additional dependencies can be installed using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For binary exploitation challenges, tools like `pwntools`, `gdb`, and `radare2` may be required.

## Usage
To execute a solution, navigate to the respective category and run the script:

```sh
python challenge_name.py
```

For binary challenges, additional debugging or execution steps may be required, such as:

```sh
./exploit.sh
```
